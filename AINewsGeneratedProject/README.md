# AI News project

### Here we work on the main backend components for a server that will extract data from unique sources, process in an AI model, be stored in PostGres, and sent to a frontend site.

1.0) The first thing that we are doing here is developing the initial scrape component with scrape1.py

2.0) With the initial data stored in our Postgres, we can query it into another service where our model will make an inference from that data, and produce an output of text.
